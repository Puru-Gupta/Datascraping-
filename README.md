# Web Scraping & Data Processing (WB) Project

## Overview  
Developed and deployed **custom web scrapers** to extract data from multiple government portals using **Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup**. The scrapers handled JavaScript-driven content, bypassed CAPTCHA codes using **OCR (Python-tesseract)**, and processed approximately **30 million rows** of data. The extracted data was structured and standardized for further analysis.

## Websites Scraped  
1. **Ease of Living (EOL) Portal** - [https://eol.nic.in](https://eol.nic.in)  
   - **Data Extracted:**  
     - Availability Of Basic Facilities
